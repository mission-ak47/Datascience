Scoring Rubric
Are my answers supported with data? (20 Points)
Tables, graphs, and charts must support your evaluation/answers.
Categorical variables: Bar plot
Continuous variables: Histogram
It MUST run in Google Collab. You will also save the Google Collab notebook as a .ipynb notebook and upload that to Canvas . (5 Points)
Public dataset (5 Points)
Pick a public dataset that can be used for Regression or Classification. You MUST get approval for your dataset from the TAs
What code is yours and what have you adapted? (5 Points)
You must explain what code you wrote and what you have done that is different. Failure to cite ANY code will result in a zero for this section.
Did I explain my code clearly? (15 Points) Your code review score will be scaled to a range of 0 to 10 and be used for this score. 
Did I explain my licensing clearly? (5 Points) Failure to cite a clear license will result in a zero for this section.

treating missing values in data.
Delete the missing value rows if there are only few records
Impute the missing values with MEDIAN value for continuous variables
Impute the missing values with MODE value for categorical variables
Interpolate the values based on nearby values
Interpolate the values based on business logic

* What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?
Added in the notebook.

* Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)

 'Status of existing checking account','Credit history', 'Purpose','Savings account/bonds','Present employment since','Personal status','Other debtors / guarantors','Property','Age','Other installment plans','Housing','Credit amount','foreign worker','Duration in month'
 methods: xgboost, SVM, adaboost

* Which independent variables have missing data? How much? 
None

* Do the training and test sets have the same data?
X_train, x_test, Y_train, y_test have been merged to find the output. Yes, some data is common.

* In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?
a person's marital status and personal status have highest correlation 

* Which predictor variables are the most important?
From the EDA and from the methods used the most important variables are: 
tatus of existing checking account	Duration in month	Purpose	Credit amount	Savings account/bonds	Present employment since	Other debtors / guarantors	Property	Age	Other installment plans	Housing	Job	Target	Sex	monthly_debit

* Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?
From the dataframe describe function, it is clear that the ranges does make sense

* What are the distributions of the predictor variables?   
* included in the notebook 

* Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?
credit amount, duration and age have outliers stating that there is a definite impact on the model. with the given data, further more removing of data can impact the final model.

* Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values?  That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error.

For this the best imputation worked is SVM.
